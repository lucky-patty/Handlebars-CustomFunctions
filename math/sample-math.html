<!--
    This file is the example use of this function

    @Definition

    I won't explain the basic of what 'math' can do but
    You can use math to change the index of the object since
    Handlebars iterate start from 0 and if you want to start with 1
    You can use this function to do so

 -->

 {{#each someList}}
  <h1>{{math @index "+" 1}}</h1>
 {{/each}}
